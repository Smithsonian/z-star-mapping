              centuries, whereby humans both influence and depend on the
              extensive ecosystem services that wetlands provide. Although
              coastal wetlands have long been considered vulnerable to
              sea-level rise, recent work has identified fascinating feedbacks
              between plant growth and geomorphology that allow wetlands to
              actively resist the deleterious effects of sea-level rise. Humans
              alter the strength of these feedbacks by changing the climate,
              nutrient inputs, sediment delivery and subsidence rates. Whether
              wetlands continue to survive sea-level rise depends largely on
              how human impacts interact with rapid sea-level rise, and
              socio-economic factors that influence transgression into adjacent
              uplands.",

  abstract = "A mixing model derived from first principles describes the bulk
              density (BD) of intertidal wetland sediments as a function of
              loss on ignition (LOI). The model assumes that the bulk volume of
              sediment equates to the sum of self-packing volumes of organic
              and mineral components or BD = 1/[LOI/k1 + (1-LOI)/k2], where k1
              and k2 are the self-packing densities of the pure organic and
              inorganic components, respectively. The model explained 78\% of
              the variability in total BD when fitted to 5075 measurements
              drawn from 33 wetlands distributed around the conterminous United
              States. The values of k1 and k2 were estimated to be 0.085 $\pm$
              0.0007 g cm(-3) and 1.99 $\pm$ 0.028 g cm(-3), respectively.
              Based on the fitted organic density (k1) and constrained by
              primary production, the model suggests that the maximum steady
              state accretion arising from the sequestration of refractory
              organic matter is $\leq$ 0.3 cm yr(-1). Thus, tidal peatlands are
              unlikely to indefinitely survive a higher rate of sea-level rise
              in the absence of a significant source of mineral sediment.
              Application of k2 to a mineral sediment load typical of East and
              eastern Gulf Coast estuaries gives a vertical accretion rate from
              inorganic sediment of 0.2 cm yr(-1). Total steady state accretion
              is the sum of the parts and therefore should not be greater than
              0.5 cm yr(-1) under the assumptions of the model. Accretion rates
              could deviate from this value depending on variation in plant
              productivity, root:shoot ratio, suspended sediment concentration,
              sediment-capture efficiency, and episodic events.",
