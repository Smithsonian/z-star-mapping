This is a python file as written on James Holmquist's desktop at Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Fall 2017. The program takes three inputs (all 3 dimensional geographic data layers): 1. a digital elevation model in NAVD88 2. the elevation of mean higher high water spring tides relative to NAVD88, and 3. propegated uncertainty of that transformation.

This file references propegated uncertainy and water level data listed in the 'raster' section, and the DEMs downloaded as listed in the 'table' section.
