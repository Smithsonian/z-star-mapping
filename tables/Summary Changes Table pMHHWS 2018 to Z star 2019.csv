Processing Step,2018 pMHHWS,2019 UpdateSpatial Extrapolation of Datum Errors,"Incorrectly assumed there was spatial structure, used empirical bayesian kriging to extrapolate datum errors between gauges.",Used inverse distance weighting to extrapolate datum errors between gauges.Error in LiDAR offset at Local Scale,Assumed LiDAR-bias uncertainty was 0.,Propegated site-scale uncertainty from using a single average vegetation correction.Covariance between MHHW and MHHWS offset,Did not incorporate covariance between MHHW and MHHWS offset in uncertainty propegation.,Included covariance in uncertainty propegation."Mobile County, AL",Did not include. Resulted in missing patches between two other surveys.,Included Mobile County in update."Baltimore County, MD",Contained an error in converting NAVD88 ft to m.,Error is corrected."South Eastern Counties (Georgetown, SC; Beufort, SC; Liberty, GA; Glynn, GA) ",Did not include.,Included in update.Mask,No Mask,Masked Out surfaces that were water or SAV in Both 2006 and 2011.Mosaicing,Mosaiced files DEM files in no particular order.,Mosaiced files so that more recent DEMs override older DEMs.Dissemination,One Single National Layer,"Labeled original files with year range, maintaining original DEM title and bounds. Created state-level versions of the files. Created simple 50%, 95%, and 99% probability of inclusion maps."
